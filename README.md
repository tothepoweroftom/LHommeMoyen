## What is this?

A ✨[Tenori-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenori-on)✨ is a dope electronic music
instrument sequencer thingie that Yamaha made for a hot minute.  
I love pixels and patterns and generating things out of pixels and patterns, which means
I LOVE the Tenori-on. Since they're rare and
mad [expensive](https://reverb.com/item/11642149-yamaha-tenori-on), I've never seen one,
so I made a JavaScript version of what I think it looks like.

You can change between drums or a synth sound (also using the **D** or **S** keys). The URL also holds the state, so you can send it to a pal to have them listen to your masterpiece. If you hit a bug, refreshing usually makes it go away.

The **Improvise** button will auto generate drums to match your synth using 
~*machine learning*~ via [Magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js) and a recurrent neural network. In the browser!!

### Ok, go make fun shit now!
